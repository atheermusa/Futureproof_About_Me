  <section id="about-me">

    <h2 id="coder-text">Hello World!</h2>

    <p>My name's Atheer Musa. I'm a 23 year old graduate, completing a degree in Electronic Engineering with Management from Kings College University. </p>

    <p>Whether itâ€™s building Augmented reality projects, coding away at a hackathon or hosting a weekly radio show about it, my life always finds itself revolving around technology! One thing I enjoy doing most is diving in headfirst and taking on new challenges, learning new skills ranging from iOS development and Unity to (very) recently HTML, CSS and Javascript! </p>

    <p>As I embark on the next stage of my life and begin building a career in technology in this uncertain world, I believe it's more important than ever to keep that feeling of wonder and look to the future!
